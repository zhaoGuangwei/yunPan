QA alternative		    Applicability	    Effectiveness	    Cost

testing			          code		          occa. failures	  medium

defect prevention	    known causes	    syst. problems	  low

inspection		        s/w artifacts	    scat. faults	    low - medium

formal verification	  formal spec.	    fault absence	    high

fault tolerance		    duplication	      rare failures	    high

failure containment	  known hazards	    rare accidents	  highest
