 #My understanding of SQA
 
 It's very important of SQA to software products. When we develop software product, as complex environment and different 
 developer's experience, we will meet a numerous of external and internal questions. To assure the software product 
 operate rightly, we must explore the potential hazard and test it's stability,efficiency and so on. Of course, this is 
 the fields of SQA.
 
    By learning the first three chapters, I learn about the ISO-9126 quality framework,quality characteristics is as follows:
    . Functionality: what is needed? 
    . Reliability: function correctly. 
    . Usability: effort to use. 
    . Efficiency: resource needed. 
    . Maintainability: correct/improve/adapt. 
    . Portability: one environment to another.
    
    I also know the defect/bug definition,which is:
    . failure: external behavior deviation from expected behavior
    . fault: internal characteristics cause for failures
    . error: incorrect/missing human action error source: conceptual mistakes etc.
    . defect: error, fault, failure collectively
    . bug/debug: problematic terms, avoid
    
    As developer, we should test by white-box,which is internal implementation. As  tester, they will test by black-box, 
    which is external specification.
    
    To develop a perfect artifact(of course,I know no silver bullet,but the word "perfect" can express my attitude),
    I will study the course very hard!
